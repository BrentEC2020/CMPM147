  Dear $last_name $first_name, $famous_title!
  
  Thank you for saving $town! 
  
  I have never been fond of pirates, but maybe some do have good hearts. I have heard stories all about the $crew Crew and their $bounty Berry Bounty. 
  
  You and your friends are just as terrifying as the legends say. I am glad we can now count on you as an ally and can never repay what you have done for us.
  
  I know better than to mess with you, $first_mate, $crewmate_1, and $crewmate_2. Please take this as a token of our appreciation. (The Town Mayor attached this note to a treasure chest that reveals the $devil_fruit)
  
  We will be forever in your debt!
  
  
  -End Note
  
  
  
  Your victory is short-lived as you have immediately run into the infamous $villain just as you hit open water. You yell at your crew to prepare for battle and you announce "$one_liner"
