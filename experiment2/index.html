                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>This program generates a living impression of a low-poly sunset using p5.js. The image makes use of gradients to imitate the color fades of the image and custom shapes to form mountains and rocks.</p>

                    <p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color: The sky, ground, sun, mountain, rocks, and star colors were sampled from the inspiring image using an online eyedropper tool.</li>
                        <li>Primitives: The stones are rendered with quad primitives.</li>
                        <li>Polygons: The mountains are created using three different custom polygons using vertex calls.</li>
                        <li>Composition: Different random seed values generate different mountain polygons, varied positioned rocks, and the number and movement of the stars.</li>
                        <li>Life: The rocks respond to the movement of the user's mouse cursor to replicate the experience of walking by the scene.</li>
                    </ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I once again had a little trouble porting over the code from Glitch to the static HTML page, but I had more confidence trying to figure it out this time around. I had a lot of fun reading through the p5.js library to learn new skills to help improve my project. I also reconfigured the mountain and tree code we were shown to fit into my project. I had a really good time being able to learn and understand p5.js a lot more than when I started. I was unable to figure out how to integrate the fullscreen function into my project. I hope I can return to this later and solve that puzzle.</p>
