                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>What are you trying to accomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>In this experiment, the goal is to create two working map generators. We created one for the underworld and the overworld. The map demonstration on my page is our overworld generator.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>We created a randomly generated map using a grid and various for loops. Each tile has its own code that is represented in the map that can be edited by the audience. Each code has a texture tied to it that is randomly generated from a handful of tiles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>Jose and I worked diligently to build something that we could both be proud of. We had a lot of trouble with our tunnels to connect the rooms, but once that was done, it was smooth sailing from there. I ran into an error when transferring the HTML code from Glitch to the static page, but that was easily solved.</p>
